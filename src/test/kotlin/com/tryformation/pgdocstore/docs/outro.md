## Future work

As FORMATION grows, we will no doubt need more features. Some features that come to mind are sharding, utilizing some of
the json features in postgres, geospatial features, or other featutes.

## Development status

This is a relatively new project; so there may be some bugs, design flaws, etc. However, I've implemented similar
stores many times before in past projects and I think I know what I'm doing. If it works for us, it might also work 
for you.

Give it a try!
